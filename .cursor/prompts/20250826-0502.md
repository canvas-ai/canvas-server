We need to update our dotfile manager with the following logic:

Dotfiles can optionaly be enabled on a per-context basis
Activating workspace dotfiles for workspace "universe"
$ dot activate universe
will activate all dotfiles indexed in the universe workspace one-by-one asking explicitly for every dotfile with y/n to skip

$ context set universe://customera/foo/bar --update-dotfiles
May deactivate dotfile ~/.ssh from universe/common/ssh and activate ~/.ssh from universe/customera/ssh if context customera/foo/bar contains a dotfile with the same local file ~/.ssh

This means that we may actually run 2 indexes
Authoritative Source (workspace repo) in canvas-server workspace's DB as a standard JSON document(same as tabs, notes etc) with localPath, repoPath, type(file|folder), encrypted or any additional practical metadata(see current implementation) 

Runtime State (per-host index) that will be placed in the machine locally to ~/.canvas/db/dotfiles.json

Suggested Flow
$ dot activate universe
- Pull dotfiles from workspace DB/repo.
- Walk them one-by-one, prompt y/n, update the per-host index.
- Apply symlinks/config changes accordingly.

$ context set universe://customera/foo/bar --update-dotfiles
- Look up dotfiles in that context.
- For any conflicts (same localPath), deactivate the current one (update per-host index), activate the contextual one.

When evaluating dotfiles to apply:
- Start with workspace dotfiles (from DB/repo).
- Apply per-host active state (from ~/.canvas/db/dotfiles.json).
- Apply context overrides (runtime decision, not persisted globally).
