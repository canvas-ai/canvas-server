# Resource address schema refactor

We are implementing a common resource address schema for canvas: [user.name]@[remote-or-remote-alias]:[resource][optional path]
This schema is to be used on all canvas-server clients(cli, electron ui, whatever rust/go or python based canvas roles the user decides to run locally)

Examples:
  userfoo@canvas.local:workspace1
  userbar@canvas.remote:context-foo
  userbaz@work.tld:workspace-baz/shell/bash # Dotfile reference when called with canvas dot
  userbas@workmachine:workspace-baf/foo/bar/baf # When called with canvas context

We'll use a common configuration store for all our client applications, by defaint in
~/.canvas/config

Minimal acceptable protection: file permissions (chmod 600) and perhaps ~/.canvas/credentials.json separate from config for easier secrets handling but we are in MVP territory so not sure about spliting it off yet/as-of-now.
For future, we can support OS keyrings.

Local configuration should use the following files/schemas
    /remotes.json
        {
            "user@remote-shortname":{
                url: https://full-canvs-server-url:port/
                apiBase: /rest/v2
                description: optional description
                auth:
                    "method": "token|password|oauth2|oidc",
                    "tokenType": "jwt",
                    "token": "..."
                },
                lastSynced: timestamp-of-last-full-sync
            }
        }
    /contexts.json
        {
            "user@remote-shortname:context_id": {
                url
                ...context object we get from remote canvas-server api when listing contexts/updating/creating individual contexts
                lastSynced: timestamp-of-last-sync
            }
        }

    /workspaces.json
        {
            "user@remote-shortname:workspace_id": {
                ...workspace object we get from remote canvas-server api when listing workspaces/updating/creating individual workspaces
                lastSynced: timestamp-of-last-sync
            }
        }
    /session-cli.json
        {
            boundRemote: user.name@remote-shortname
            defaultWorkspace: user@remote-shortname:workspace_id, optional
            boundContext: user@remote-shortname:context_id, optional
            boundAt: timestamp
        }

Every canvas-server instance holds a index of all its local users, contexts, workspaces but to
a) not overengineer our MVP
b) not overcomplicate the UX
we'll treat canvas-servers / remotes as with git or ssh
Every Context and every Workspace can also be accessed using a dedicated api-token(you can share your workspace with other users by creating a api token(ro or rw) for said workspace or context - not sure where to store that information, probably in workspaces.json worksapce.auth.type? and if auth.type is token we use workspace token to access that workspace

Whenever canvas cli does any changes related to the context(mostly changing its URL) or workspace(changing its parameters) - we get a full object back, we should therefore update our local index right away
$ canvas context bind user@remote:context-id
$ canvas context set workspace-id://some/context/path
Returns a context object which we can save

The following commands should be implemented in our main bun/node based CLI
canvas remote add user@remote-shortname url --token <optional token, otherwise we ask for a password>
canvas remote list | ls
canvas remote remove user@remote-shortname
canvas remote sync user@remote-shortname
canvas remote ping user@remote-shortname
canvas remote bind user@remote-shortname # To select a remote as default, we should write ~/.canvas/session.json
canvas remote login user@remote-shortname # JWT
canvas remote logout user@remote-shortname # JWT
remote rename old new
remote show user@remote # Dump remote details

On login, we should call
GET apiBase/workspaces
GET apiBase/contexts

then update our local indexes
This should also be triggered with the sync command above

Indexes needs to be updated on a per-resource basis, not just by overwriting the whole file but by selectively updating the resource

So
Guess lets devise a plan to update the canvas-server backend and canvas-cli and start working
