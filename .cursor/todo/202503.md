- Working CLI Insert functionality

```
context note add sample note --title foo
cat /var/log/syslog | grep nvidia | grep 202503 | context note add --title bar
context url add google.com 
context list
context list notes
context switch 
```

- Move Tree under Workspaces

- Reconsider initializing workspace and context managers globally, adding userID as a parameter for each
- Current setup was meant for scenarios where each user environment would run in a separate container
    - This setup could be achieved by reverting to the old design where canvas-server was a single-user application
    - We'd create a orchestrator on top, question is whether to do it on a per user or per workspace basis
    - User can have his data directory accessible via webdav and/or s3, his dotfiles accessible over a ssh+git
    - We aim for a roaming profile setup,
