# Context WebSocket Events - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 **Event Forwarding Chain Complete**

We have successfully implemented a robust event forwarding system that enables real-time updates across the entire application stack:

```
📄 Database (SynapsD) → 🏢 Workspace → 🎯 Context → 📋 ContextManager → 🌐 WebSocket → 🖥️  Client
```

## ✅ **What We've Implemented**

### 1. **Database Level Events** (`src/services/synapsd/`)
- ✅ Database emits events on all document operations
- ✅ Tree operations emit path and layer events
- ✅ Events include full context information

### 2. **Workspace Event Forwarding** (`src/managers/workspace/lib/Workspace.js`)
- ✅ Listens to database and tree events
- ✅ Forwards events with workspace metadata
- ✅ Proper event cleanup on workspace shutdown
- ✅ Events: `workspace:document:*`, `workspace:tree:*`

### 3. **Context Event Forwarding** (`src/managers/context/lib/Context.js`)
- ✅ Listens to workspace events
- ✅ Forwards relevant events with context information
- ✅ **Smart workspace switching** with proper event listener cleanup
- ✅ Path-based relevance filtering
- ✅ Events: `context:workspace:*`

### 4. **WebSocket Context API** (`src/api/websocket/context.js`)
- ✅ Enhanced event forwarding (37 event types!)
- ✅ User access control for events
- ✅ Tree operation handlers
- ✅ Document CRUD operations
- ✅ Real-time event broadcasting

## 🔄 **Event Flow Example**

When a document is inserted into the database:

1. **📄 Database**: `document:inserted` event emitted
2. **🏢 Workspace**: Receives and forwards as `workspace:document:inserted`
3. **🎯 Context**: Receives and forwards as `context:workspace:document:inserted`
4. **📋 ContextManager**: Receives context events and forwards to websockets
5. **🌐 WebSocket**: Checks user permissions and forwards to connected clients
6. **🖥️  Client**: Receives real-time notification

## 📡 **WebSocket Events Available**

### Core Context Events
- `context:url:set`
- `context:updated`
- `context:locked`/`context:unlocked`
- `context:created`/`context:deleted`
- `context:acl:updated`/`context:acl:revoked`

### Document Events (Direct)
- `document:insert`/`document:update`/`document:remove`/`document:delete`

### Workspace Events (Forwarded)
- `context:workspace:document:inserted`
- `context:workspace:document:updated`
- `context:workspace:document:removed`
- `context:workspace:document:deleted`

### Tree Events (Forwarded)
- `context:workspace:tree:path:inserted`
- `context:workspace:tree:path:moved`
- `context:workspace:tree:path:copied`
- `context:workspace:tree:path:removed`
- `context:workspace:tree:document:*` (with batch variants)
- `context:workspace:tree:path:locked`/`unlocked`
- `context:workspace:tree:layer:merged:up`/`down`
- `context:workspace:tree:saved`/`loaded`/`recalculated`
- `context:workspace:tree:error`

## 🛠️ **WebSocket Handlers Available**

### Context Management
- `context:list` - Get user's contexts
- `context:get` - Get specific context
- `context:url:get`/`context:url:set` - URL operations

### Document Operations
- `context:documents:list` - List documents in context
- `context:documents:insert` - Insert multiple documents
- `context:documents:update` - Update multiple documents
- `context:documents:remove` - Remove documents from context
- `context:documents:delete` - Delete documents from database
- `context:document:*` - Single document variants

### Tree Operations (NEW!)
- `context:tree:get` - Get context tree structure
- `context:tree:path:insert` - Create new tree paths
- `context:tree:path:remove` - Remove tree paths
- `context:tree:path:move` - Move tree paths
- `context:tree:path:copy` - Copy tree paths

## 🔐 **Security & Access Control**

- ✅ **User Authentication**: All operations require authenticated user
- ✅ **Context Access Control**: Users only receive events from contexts they have access to
- ✅ **Permission Checking**: Events filtered based on user permissions
- ✅ **Isolation**: Users cannot access other users' contexts or events

## 🧪 **Testing**

We've created comprehensive tests demonstrating:

1. **Event Forwarding Chain** (`test-event-forwarding.js`)
   - Database → Workspace → Context event flow
   
2. **Workspace Switching** (`test-workspace-switching.js`)
   - Proper event listener cleanup and setup during workspace switches
   
3. **WebSocket Integration** (`test-websocket-context-events.js`)
   - Complete end-to-end event flow to connected clients
   - User access control verification

## 🎉 **Key Benefits**

1. **Real-time Updates**: Clients receive instant notifications of changes
2. **Multi-Context Support**: Multiple contexts can listen to the same workspace
3. **Workspace Switching**: Contexts can switch workspaces without losing events
4. **Event Isolation**: Users only receive relevant events they have access to
5. **Scalability**: Event system handles multiple users and contexts efficiently
6. **Tree Operations**: Full support for tree manipulation via websockets

## 🚀 **Ready for Web UI**

The websocket context system is now ready for frontend integration! The web UI can:

- Connect to context websockets and receive real-time updates
- Perform all context and document operations via websockets
- Manipulate tree structures in real-time
- Get instant notifications when other users make changes
- Switch between contexts and workspaces seamlessly

All the backend infrastructure is in place for a responsive, real-time collaborative interface! 🎯
